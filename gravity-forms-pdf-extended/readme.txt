Automatically generate, email and download PDF documents from Gravity Forms entries

== Description ==

**Gravity PDF is the ultimate third-party PDF automation tool for generating digital PDFs using the popular form-builder plugin Gravity Forms.**

= Highly Customizable PDFs =

Out of the box you get four highly-customizable PDF designs. Within minutes, you can personalize the look and feel by adding your company logo, header, footer, paper size / orientation, font, color and size. If the free designs don't suit, select from our range of templates in the [Template Shop](https://gravitypdf.com/store/#templates), [go bespoke and have a template build by our team](https://gravitypdf.com/bespoke/), or [build your own using HTML/CSS/PHP](https://docs.gravitypdf.com/v6/developers/start-customising).

= Send as Email Attachment =

Gravity PDF can automatically email the PDF to both the admin and the user as soon as the form is completed. You can combine this feature with a Gravity Forms payment add-on [to sell personalized reports, gift certificates, or generate PDF invoices](https://gravitypdf.com/news/sell-personalized-pdf-documents-using-gravity-forms/).

= Privacy, Security, and GDPR =

Gravity PDF generates PDFs on your web server, and no third-party service receives your sensitive Gravity Forms entry data. [Robust security protects your documents](https://docs.gravitypdf.com/v6/users/pdf-security), and [the plugin is GDPR-compliant](https://docs.gravitypdf.com/v6/users/gdpr-and-gravity-pdf) for our European friends.

> Digital document management with WordPress and Gravity Forms just became simple with Gravity PDF!

= Free Feature =

* **Unlimited Use, No Restrictions** – There are zero hard limits to the number of PDFs you can configure across all your forms or generate on your entries. Gravity PDF does **NOT** stamp documents with our logo, limit the number of PDFs you can create per month, or purposefully restrict essential functionality to force you to upgrade to a paid plan.
* **Privacy and Security** - your form data is never sent to a third party to generate the PDFs and the documents are generated directly on your web server. [Strong access control policies are put in place](https://docs.gravitypdf.com/v6/users/pdf-security#default-security) to prevent unauthenticated access to your PDFs.
* **Multilingual** – a multitude of languages from across the globe can be displayed in PDFs, include complex scripts like Hebrew, Arabic, Thai, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean.
* **Additional Fonts** – match your branding and enhance the overall look and feel of PDFs by install your own fonts.
* **Columns** – use [Drag and Drop columns](https://docs.gravityforms.com/working-with-columns/) in Gravity Forms and [PDFs will automatically mimic that layout](https://docs.gravitypdf.com/v6/users/columns).
* **Shortcode and Merge Tags** – You can generate a link or URL to PDFs [using both shortcodes and merge tags](https://docs.gravitypdf.com/v6/users/shortcodes-and-mergetags) so your users can download the PDF right after form submission.
* **Export Entries** – include the direct link to any PDF(s) when [exporting your form entries](https://docs.gravitypdf.com/v6/users/include-pdfs-in-entry-export)
* **Webhooks Add-on** – [send the direct PDF link with Webhook requests](https://docs.gravitypdf.com/v6/users/webhooks-support) when using Gravity Forms Webhooks add-on.
* **Gravity Flow** – create complex workflows [using Gravity Flow](https://gravityflow.io) and automatically email Gravity PDF-generated documents at any step in the workflow.
* **GravityView** – add links to PDFs when building a members area [using GravityView](https://gravityview.co) + [Advanced Filtering add-on](https://gravityview.co/extensions/advanced-filter/).
* **Background Processing** – generating PDFs on form submission can be time consuming. [Offload it to a background process](https://docs.gravitypdf.com/v6/users/background-processing) will ensure form submissions are processed faster.
* **Design PDFs** – developers can build their own PDF templates using HTML, CSS, and PHP [with the help of our developer documentation](https://docs.gravitypdf.com/v6/developers/start-customising).
* **Documentation and Support** – there is [extensive documentation](https://docs.gravitypdf.com/v6/users/five-minute-install) covering every feature of Gravity PDF that you can comb through, plus we provide [free general support to all users](https://gravitypdf.com/support/).

This is a great feature for capturing e-signatures, selling PDF reports /  certificates / gift cards, or providing an on-screen proof before the PDF is sent to the printers (perfect for business cards).
